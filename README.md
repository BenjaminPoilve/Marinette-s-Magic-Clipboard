# Marinette-s-Magic-Clipboard
This extension will help you make links on Microsoft word

This is a very simple extension that create a new shortcut (CMD+CTRL+C) to create a rich (HTML) link. 
It finds the title of the article (thanks to the metas) and use it to make a <a> link which is properly interpreted by most text editors.

It also creates a screenshot of tweets. 

Made it for my girlfriend, whose job made her copy/paste article to words hundreds of time a day.

You can find it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marinettes-magic-clipboar/obmphbnafagblfljefhmiekhaakddoam) in the chrome addons store.
